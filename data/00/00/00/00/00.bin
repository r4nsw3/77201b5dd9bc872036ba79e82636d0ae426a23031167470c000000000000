  |   A fungipunk fantasy about love, loss, and holding on, spun into the   |
  |   form of a beautiful and strange color-based puzzle game.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   She Remembered Caterpillars is a color-matching puzzle game with an   |
  |   unsettling fungipunk aesthetic. Set in a phantasgamorphic world of    |
  |   writhing caterpillars, brightly-colored Gammies, and living           |
  |   architecture, the game will have players eavesdropping on what        |
  |   appears to be one scientist's quest to save her father.               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As the chapters progress, more of this strange universe will reveal   |
  |   itself: what manner of cataclysm occurred here? Who are the players   |
  |   involved? And what exactly are the Gammies doing in these             |
  |   dreamscapes?                                                          |
